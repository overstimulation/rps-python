# Rock Paper Scissors ‚úä‚úã‚úåÔ∏è (and Lizard ü¶é Spock üññ!) üéÆ

This is a simple Python script implementing the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors. As a bonus, it also includes the advanced version: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock! This project was created as a checkpoint for the ["The Legend of Python üêç"](https://www.codedex.io/python) course on [Cod√©dex](https://www.codedex.io/).

## Features

* Play the standard game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
* Option to unlock and play the advanced version: Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.
* Clear and user-friendly command-line interface.
* Random computer opponent selection.
* Allows for multiple rounds.

## How to Play

1.  **Prerequisites:** You will need Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Download:** Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3.  **Run the script:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the script using the following command:

    ```bash
    python rock_paper_scissors.py
    ```

    *(Replace `rock_paper_scissors.py` with the actual name of the Python file if you've renamed it.)*
4.  **Follow the prompts:** The script will guide you through the game. Simply enter the number corresponding to your choice when prompted.

## Advanced Mode

After winning a round of the standard Rock Paper Scissors, you will be given the option to play the advanced version, Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

The rules for the advanced version are as follows:

* **Rock** beats Scissors and Lizard
* **Paper** beats Rock and Spock
* **Scissors** beats Paper and Lizard
* **Lizard** beats Paper and Spock
* **Spock** beats Rock and Scissors

The script handles these winning combinations automatically, so you just need to make your choice!
